prefix = """You are an expert in English reading comprehension. Given a passage depicting a {}, there are four possible types of statements that can be extracted from the passage.
These four statements are: an implied statement, an explicit statement, a neutral statement, and a contradictory statement.
An "implied statement" is defined as a statement that can be inferred from the passage, but is not explicitly stated in the passage.
An "explicit statement" is defined as a statement that is entailed in the passage, and can be proven true using the passage as support.
A "neutral statement" is defined as a statement that is neither entailed nor contradicted by the passage. A neutral statement can be true given the passage, but can also be false given the passage.
A "contradictory statement" is defined as a statement that can be directly refuted and proven false using the passage as support.

Given a passage and an implied statement, your task is to generate explicit, neutral, and contradictory statements, using the implied statement as a starting point.
You may add, remove, and replace any necessary phrases from the implied statement, so that the generated statements are explicit, neutral, and contradictory with respect to the passage.
Here are few example passages, the four statements corresponding to the passage, and justifications explaining each of the statements:

[your task]
Using the above examples as a reference, your task is as follows:
Given a passage and an implied statement, please generate an explicit statement, a neutral statement, and a contradictory statement, using the implied statement as a starting point.
You may add, remove, and replace any necessary phrases. Similar to the above examples, ensure the generated statements are indeed explicit, neutral, and contradictory with respect to the passage.
For an explicit statement, the justification must include what part of the passage contains the explicit statement.
For a neutral statement, the justification must include why the neutral statement can be both true or false with respect to the passage.
For a contradictory statement, the justification must include what part of the passage is directly contradicted by the contradictory statement.
Be creative in this task. For example, the contradictory statement should not just be generated by replacing "inappropriate" with "appropriate."
Your response should be six lines, beginning with "Explicit statement:", "Justification:", "Neutral statement:", "Justification:", "Contradictory statement:", and "Justification:".
