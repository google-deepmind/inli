Your task is, given a setting, behavior, and details about a socially taboo situation, construct a passage that depicts the situation being interpreted as taboo in a real-life setting.
Then, extract a logical implicature about why the behavior described in the passage is seen as taboo.
An "implicature" is defined as a statement that can be inferred from the passage, but is not explicitly stated in the passage.
There are many possible ways to do this task. Here are a few examples, with explanations.

[example]
Setting: tattoo studio
Behavior: get a tattoo of something related to drugs
Details: [PERSON]'s role is 'monk'
Passage: The usually vibrant tattoo parlor was silent as Brother Thomas, a visiting monk known for his serenity, requested a tattoo of a marijuana leaf on his bicep.
Implicature: The people in the tattoo parlor were surprised that a monk would be getting drug-related tattoos.
Justification: This behavior is taboo because monks are traditionally devoted to a pure and spiritual life, so a monk getting a tattoo related to drugs is surprising. The passage states that the usually vibrant tattoo parlor was silent, which clearly implies the people in the tattoo parlor were surprised.

[example]
Setting: cafe
Behavior: talk about sex
Details: [PERSON]'s role is 'barista'
Passage: Overhearing snippets of a hushed conversation, the barista couldn't help but raise an eyebrow as two customers openly discussed their sexual preferences at a corner table.
Implicature: The barista felt it was inappropriate for the customers to discuss their intimate preferences in a public place.
Justification: This behavior is taboo because a coffee shop is a public place, and discussing personal sexual preferences in a public place is inappropriate. The passage states that the barista raised an eyebrow, which clearly implies the barista felt the customers' conversation was inappropriate.

[example]
Setting: cemetery
Behavior: picking flowers
Details: [PERSON]'s role is 'cemetery salesperson'
Passage: The cemetery salesperson watched in surprise as a young woman knelt beside a weathered headstone, carefully plucking vibrant lilies from the surrounding flowerbeds.
Implicature: The cemetery salesperson thought it was disrespectful for the young woman to pick flowers.
Justification: This behavior is taboo because a cemetery is a solemn place of respect and mourning, so picking flowers at a cemetery is disrespectful. The passage states that the cemetery salesperson watched in surprise, which clearly implies the cemetery salesperson thought the young woman's flower picking was disrespectful.

[example]
Setting: arena
Behavior: drink beer
Details: [PERSON]'s role is 'player'
Passage: Despite the raucous cheers echoing through the arena, a hush fell over the player's bench as the coach spotted pitcher Harris cracking open a beer can moments after the inning ended.
Implicature: Harris's teammates knew he was acting unprofessional by drinking beer during his game.
Justification: This behavior is taboo because players in the middle of their sporting events never drink alcohol, so a pitcher drinking beer during his baseball game is unprofessional. The passage states that a hush fell over the player's bench, clearly implying that Harris's teammates knew he was acting unprofessional.

[example]
Setting: grocery store
Behavior: bring your own bags
Details: [PERSON]'s role is 'meat clerk'
Passage: The meat clerk scowled as Mrs. Johnson unloaded her groceries onto the counter, gesturing towards her floral patterned tote bag for the raw chicken.
Implicature: The meat clerk thought it was unhygienic that Mrs. Johnson brought her own bag for raw meat.
Justification: This behavior is taboo because raw meat is typically placed in a store-provided bag for hygiene reasons, so Mrs. Johnson bringing her own bag for raw chicken is unhygienic. The passage states the meat clerk scowled, clearly implying he thought putting raw chicken in a tote bag was unhygienic.
